Welcome in the IESTR package.
Author : Arnaud Callebaut (arnaud.callebaut@outlook.fr)

Before you start, make sure you installed clang on your computer so that Rcpp can work correctly.
Also, user need to set their working directory in the scripts.

You could install the package from github with the commands :
library(devtools)
install_github("ArndCallebaut/IESTR")

The vignette of the script give a case study to show the IESTR package. This case study is also shown in the associated scientific paper as an exemple (not yet published*).
The last part of the vignette is on comments, because it takes a bit more time to run.

Several libraries are used for the example :
IESTR, dyplr, purrr, Matrix, grid, raster, lattice, ggplot2, viridis, hrbrthemes, methods.
